    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>A unique invention, the French taco has little in common with a traditional Mexican taco. Now a fast-food staple in France and beyond, this griddled meal can contain practically any filling, so long as it fits in a flour tortilla. Learn more about the origins of French tacos and how to make them at home.</p>
    <h1>What are French tacos</h1>
    <p>French tacos (“tacos” can be plural or singular) consist of late-night staples like french fries and chicken fingers topped with cheese, folded into a flour tortilla, and cooked on a griddle. While French cuisine usually conjures images of rich, heavy dishes redolent of butter and cream, this simple sandwich has become popular nationwide (and beyond). </p>
